# Group4GameProject
## Team: Carter I, Chase C, Jesse M & Jack M
## Class: IGME 106
This repo is for a class project in the IGME 106 at RIT. 

# The primary goals of this project are the following:
1. Practice with the development of a larger project over the course of a semester
2. To gain experience working as a part of a small team
3. To implement a variety of game-related algorithms and data structures
4. To create a portfolio-worthy game using the skills you’ve learned so far
5. (Hopefully) have some fun in the process

# Assignment Milestones:
1: Design and Architecture
The main goal is establishing your group’s game concept, game play, and a prioritized feature list. Your group will create
mockups for initial visual style and user interfaces and create a basic architecture (classes, state machines, etc.). Your
team will determine which parts of your game will be data-driven (read in from external files), and plan the type of files
your team will create to manage that data. Your team will also establish the processes to keep yourselves organized and
manage tasks.
2: Setting up a Framework
This milestone’s goal is to have a “bare bones” game running. Your game should start up and some of the core
functionality is present, such as character movement, game states, a menu system, and more. Code stubs will be
included for most components, in addition to working implementations of core functionality.
Since your games are data-driven, your team will develop one external tool to help facilitate preparing data for a usable
format for your game. This tool will allow your team to quickly and easily alter core data.
2a: First Playable
Your team has a game, kind of, sort of! Your game is a basic, working game. Your game algorithms are in place, all of
your game states are functional, your external tool is complete and your game is data-driven. It might not be perfect or
pretty yet. In-class playtesting may occur during this milestone.
3: A Completed Game
The last milestone allows students time to finish and polish your game. Play-testing has occurred, and your team
responds to user feedback. Art is in place and your game feels “good.” If your team has extra time, additional features
could be added to the game. The project is wrapped up, and all documentation is accurate. Your team will work
together to reflect upon your processes through the completion of a post-mortem.
Due Dates
While due dates are included in the first milestone, all due dates are subject to change. Students will be given adequate
advanced notice of a change in due date. Due dates for milestones 2, 2a and 3 will be announced at a later date.
